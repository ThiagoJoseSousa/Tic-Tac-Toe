# Tic-Tac-Toe (Proposed by The Odin Project)
Tic tac toe game using HTML CSS and pure Javascript

What i learned: 
MiniMax algorithm, its use of recursive functions, how to create modular code, factory functions, arrow functions, array properties, closures, IIFE, forEach, and how to organize code.

As I was sick, I didn't want to practice, but I had to push myself to learn something. So I handwrote chris-kamps code while searching for the meaning of everything.
